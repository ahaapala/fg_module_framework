					<name type="string">Kaldresh</name>
					<text type="formattedtext">
						<p>The Vistani of the Kaldresh tasque are generally the most practical of the Vistani, concerning themselves more with crafts and trade than entertainment or mysticism. Kaldreshites tend to be physically fit and well suited for long travel and hard labor. They are pragmatic and somber in both dress and demeanor, eschewing unnecessary ostentation. </p>
						<p>The Kaldresh are polite to giorgio and put up with insults and harassment that Vistani of other tasques would not likely suffer. This is merely an extension of their practicality, as they recognize the importance and necessity of giorgio coin. This is not to say that they are friendly with giorgio; they suffer their company but almost never accept them as friends. </p>
						<h>Powers</h>
						<p>The Kaldresh are the tasque least concerned with mystical matters, but they are not without powers of their own. They are apparently extremely long lived, and indeed, the Kaldresh believe that they are removed from time altogether. They do not appear to mean this metaphorically, and their powers of fortune-telling would seem to support their beliefs. A Kaldreshite seer is able to see events far in the past or in the future as if they were occurring now, and to the Kaldresh that may indeed seem to be the case. </p>
						<p>The Kaldresh also have an unusual talent for locating conflict. Wherever blood is about to be spilled in war, it seems as though the Kaldresh have already arrived, ready to sell weapons or provide healing to the soldiers. </p>
						<h>Crafts</h>
						<p>The Kaldresh survive by crafting goods and performing services for the giorgio. Each tribe of the Kaldresh specializes in a different craft. Many of their crafts go to supply armies on the march. In many ways, the Kaldresh remove the necessity for supply wagons, as they always seem to have what an army might need and seem to be there to provide it. This is certainly a profitable skill for the Kaldresh, but it gives them an unfortunate reputation as feasters on human misery. Giorgio who know of the Kaldresh often call them &#34;carrion crows.&#34; Some even claim that they cause conflicts just so they can have the opportunity to profit from them. The Kaldresh ignore these insults, knowing that the giorgio need no encouragement to fight amongst themselves. </p>
						<p>When no wars are being fought, the Kaldresh set up camps on the edge of villages. They sell their goods at prices just low enough to undercut the local merchants, earning them no small amount of enmity. After a few days, they pack up and move on to the next town. </p>
						<h>Tribes:</h>
						<p>There are three known tribes within the Kaldresh tasque: the Kamii, the Equaar, and the Vatraska. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00004@Ravenloft Supplemental">Kamii</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>The Kamii are excellent metalworkers, rivaling dwarves in their skills. They craft and sell weapons, armor, metal jewelry, tools . . . virtually anything made of metal can be found and purchased at a Kamii camp. They do not create magical items and therefore rarely have them for sale, but they do craft and sell masterwork weapons. </p>
						<p>The Kamii also sell &#34;cursed&#34; weapons to those who insult or displease them. These weapons appear to be normal, even high-quality weapons, but they are subtly and skillfully flawed. &#34;Cursed&#34; weapons suffer a -1 enhancement penalty to attack and damage rolls. The weapons are not magically cursed and may be dropped or discarded at any time, but the flaws are so skillfully concealed that an Appraise check (DC 20) is required to notice anything wrong with them. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00003@Ravenloft Supplemental">Equaar</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>The Equaar are expert animal breeders, handlers, and trainers. When traveling they resemble nothing so much as shepherds working to make sure their disparate flocks and packs of animals do not wander off. Virtually any kind of animal can be bought at an Equaar camp, including animals that have already been trained. Trained animals sold by the Equaar include riding animals such as horses and ponies, pack animals such as donkeys and mules, and hunting animals such as dogs and falcons. Equaar horses are particularly prized and sell for at least twice as much as standard horses. They are worth the cost, however, as each is fully trained to obey a variety of commands. Equaar horses bond with their owners quickly and accept no other riders.</p>
						<p>All of the Equaar have natural skills with animals and can be considered to have the Animal Empathy and Handle Animal skills at high levels. Many of the Equaar also possess the Track feat, enabling them to find wayward animals. They have been known to sell their services as trackers as well. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00006@Ravenloft Supplemental">Vatmska</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>The Vatraska are healers and herbalists. They are a small tribe, and their caravans are difficult to find. Even when found, they may be mistaken for the Kamii, for they supplement their healing arts with blacksmithing and tinkering, though they do not approach the skill of the Kamii. </p>
						<p>All Vatraska are trained from a young age in the healing arts and therefore possess the Alchemy and Heal skills to some degree. The Vatraska specialize in brewing healing potions, but virtually any variety of potion can be found at their camps. They are also excellent makers of poisons and sell them with no questions asked. Their dual nature as healers and sellers of poisons may seem like a contradiction, but the Vatraska act out of neither altruism nor malevolence. They simply do what they must to survive.</p>

					<name type="string">Boemians</name>
					<text type="formattedtext">
						<p>Unlike the Kaldresh, the Boemians strive for ostentation. They lack the Kaldreshite talents for crafts, so they turn to services instead, and the service they specialize in is entertainment. The Boem flair for entertainment pervades their lives. Boem caravans are constantly accompanied by music. The people sing as they go about their daily business. Their vardos are heavily decorated and their clothing brightly colored. Even giorgio who fear and hate the Vistani cannot help but be entranced by the sounds and sights of a passing Boem caravan. </p>
						<p>The Boemians are a passionate people, and their moods shift abruptly. In public, out among the giorgio, the Boemians are charming, lively, and romantic. They are open and friendly but cultivate just enough mystery to leave the giorgio curious and eager. In private, amongst only themselves, the Boemians are dark, angry, and brooding. They lament having to play the clowns for foolish townspeople who despise them. They bitterly deride giorgio for their settled lifestyle, yet they are equally jealous that they have no home to call their own. Boem camps are quiet and tense with a palpable feeling of anger in the air. They do not sing at night as they do in the day, instead telling tales of tragedy and horror. The Boemians are a tormented people, yet every morning they find the resolve to go forth and make merry once more. </p>
						<p>Powers: The Boemians do not take a very mystical view of themselves or the world. They do not see themselves as removed from time as the Kaldresh do, and indeed their life spans appear to be much shorter than those of the Kaldresh. For them, time marches on inexorably and immovably, and no creature is capable of escaping it. This does not mean the Boemians lack the Kaldreshite skill at fortune-telling, however. Indeed, if the past and future are fixed and certain, as the Boem believe, all one has to do is map their course. Boemian seers are often able to see specific moments in the past or future with total clarity, but what lies between then and now may be a mystery. How well a seer guesses what lies between then and now is the true measure of his skill. </p>
						<p>The Boemians seem to radiate a calming influence on others. Having negative feelings in the presence of a Boemian is a difficult thing to do. Anyone in the presence of a Boemian must make a Will save (DC 15) each round to maintain a negative feeling such as anger, suspicion, or hatred. Those who fail find those feelings suddenly dissipate, scattered by the Boemians natural likability. In game terms, those who fail the save ignore the Boemian's Outcast Rating, reacting to the Boemian as they would to their fellow townspeople. This effect is similar to the charm person spell, and any being immune to that spell is unaffected. Individuals with a specific reason to hate or dislike the Boemian, or Boemians as a whole, get a +4 bonus to their save and need save only once to be immune to the effect for the rest of the encounter. </p>
						<h>Crafts</h>
						<p>The Boemians are, above all, performers. Virtually anything that might serve to entertain can be found at a Boem camp. Indeed, a Boem camp resembles a carnival more than it does a caravan. Musical performances, plays, acts of prestidigitation, fortune-telling, and more can all be seen for a small price. The Boemians supplement these performances by selling a variety of trinkets and potions. They lack the skill of the Kaldresh in crafting such items, but they would never tell a<i> giorgio</i> such a thing. Indeed, the Boemians are quite skilled at making a worthless object seem like a priceless treasure. </p>
						<p>The Boemians also offer other, more illicit services. Thievery, smuggling, and even kidnappings or assassinations can be contracted at Boem camps if one seeks them out. The Boemians do not advertise such services, but they have an uncanny knack for sniffing out and pulling aside interested buyers.</p>
						<p>Tribes: The Boem <i>tasque </i>consists of two known tribes, the Naiat and the Corvara. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00005@Ravenloft Supplemental">Naiat</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>The Naiat, like the Equaar, are well known for their animal handling skills, but where the Equaar raise animals for sale the Naiat train animals to serve as entertainment. Bear wrestling is a popular sport at Naiat camps, and audiences thrill to the tricks per-formed by Naiat trained dogs and horses. Additionally, most every Naiat camp contains at least one skilled illusionist who can craft amazing, if imaginary, vistas and experiences for giorgio customers. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00002@Ravenloft Supplemental">Corvara</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>The Corvara are not particularly adept at any openly marketable skills. Even their showmanship is inferior to that of the Naiat, though they try to compensate for that by offering unsavory diversions such as gambling, drinking, narcotic dens, and cock-fighting. They have also perfected the art of con artistry and seek to bilk giorgio out of every last coin they possibly can. Inevitably they start to grate on their hosts beyond the ability of natural Boem charm to repair, and thus they tend to relocate much more often than the average Vistani tribe.</p>

						<p>The Manusa are the most exotic and aloof of the three tasques. Their numbers are far fewer than those of the other tasques, with perhaps as few as one caravan representing each tribe. Unlike other Vistani tasques, they do not market goods or services to the giorgio. Seeking out their company is a wasted effort, for they are never found unless they wish to be, and they usually wish to be alone. Even other Vistani find the Manusa impossible to track down.</p>
						<p>When they are encountered, the Manusa are taciturn and distant. They rarely answer questions, and when they do their responses are cryptic. When they wish to speak, their words are direct and brief, with no time wasted on pleasantries. They care little for their appearance and are often disheveled and dirty as a result. They grow their hair long, and the men do not trim their beards or mustaches. The men dress in simple wool robes and caps, while the women where colorful dresses and scarves. The Manusa appear older on average than most Vistani, and more burned and beaten by the weather. Their eyes are bright and piercing.</p>
						<h>Powers</h>
						<p>The known powers of the Manusa are vast, and it is almost a certainty that they possess other powers that remain mysterious. The Manusa appear to be able to manipulate time as if it were plaything. While the Kaldresh stand removed from time, and the Boemians know it as an irresistible force, the Manusa bend it to suit their whims. They can see through time as others might through a window, walk through it as others might through a doorway. They can even take others with them if they choose. Time is so malleable to them as to be almost meaningless. </p>
						<p>The Manusa also seem to be able to command the very Mists themselves, a power at least as impressive and daunting as their control over time. They can cause the Mists to rise at will and can use them to travel to any part of Ravenloft they wish in an instant. </p>
						<p>The nature of these powers is a mystery, and it may be best that it remains so. The Manusa do not appear inclined to use their great powers for personal gain; any others who managed to gain hold of their secrets would almost certainly lack their restraint.</p>
						<h>Crafts</h>
						<p>The Manusa do not have a craft in the way the Kaldresh and Boemians do. They do not interact with the giorgio with any frequency and seem able to provide for themselves in all respects. When the Manusa seek out a giorgio, it is almost certainly because they wish to request a service, not because they wish to provide one. </p>
						<h>Tribes</h>
						<p>There are two tribes in the Manusa tasque: the Canjar and the Zarovan. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00001@Ravenloft Supplemental">Canjar</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>All members of the Canjar tribe possess an innate talent for magic. Every adult has at least one level in the sorcerer class. In light of their other powers, the Canjar rarely seek to develop their sorcery to the fullest extent; 6th level seems to be the effective maximum they can achieve. Still, they are effective spellcasters and are believed to have many arcane spells known only to themselves. </p>
						<p>The Canjar are superb crafters of magic items, but such items are never available for sale. They might provide them as payment for services or as gifts to extraordinary individuals. </p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="reference_subrace" recordname="reference.racedata.half-vistani.subraces.id-00007@Ravenloft Supplemental">Zarovan</link>
						</linklist>
						<p>Even other Vistani fear the Zarovan, for to the Zarovan other Vistani are as ignorant and helpless as the giorgio. The Zarovan bear their cousins no ill will, but the Zarovan have an unsettling degree of power over the other Vistani tribes. The Vistani believe that the Zarovan are the source of all Vistani magic. All the special abilities that separate the Vistani from the giorgio are said to flow from the Zarovan, and the Zarovan are thought to be able to cut or redirect that flow as they wish. Fearful of this power, the Vistani honor and respect the Zarovan while at the same time trying to avoid their attention.</p>

				<h>The Vistani</h>
				<p><i>She had very red lips and very black eyes, she was built like a greyhound, and had the tongue of the devil</i></p>
				<p>&#151; F. Marion Crawford, &#34;For the Blood Is the Life&#34;</p>
				<p>The Vistani are the most enigmatic of Ravenloft's inhabitants. These wandering gypsies somehow seem to be both separate from and intertwined with everything that goes on in the Land of Mists. They are secretive and insular, keeping themselves isolated from the giorgio, yet provide services and entertainment to those same giorgio when the price is right. The mystery that surrounds them, and their notorious power to curse those who wrong them, cause them to be feared and hated by many, yet their independent spirit and ability to travel the nighttime wilderness without fear lead them to be respected and even admired by many others. They are a people composed of contradictions, and it is unlikely that anyone not of their blood will ever fully understand them.</p>
				<h>Appearance</h>
				<p>The appearance of the Vistani can be as varied as those of any other people, but certain characteristics are prevalent among them. Their complexions are naturally dark and are often made darker by exposure to the sun. Their hair is almost always dark and is usually deep black. Their eyes are usually dark as well, with brown being the most common shade, though hazel and green eyes are not infrequent.</p>
				<h>Lifestyle</h>
				<p>The Vistani are a people without a home. They gather together in caravans, the members of which are all part of a single extended family. These caravans wander the Land of Mists, their belongings carried by pack animals or loaded into covered wagons known as vardos. The master of the caravan is called the captain, an adult male Vistani who decides when the caravan makes camp, how long it stays, and where it travels to next. He also delegates responsibility to the other members of the caravan and has the final word in all matters of trade and commerce. Even the captain, however, is subservient to the raunie, the matriarch of the caravan. The raunie is often the oldest female Vistani in the caravan, though this is not always the case. The raunie passes judgment and gives sentence when crimes are committed within a caravan, and her voice is listened to and respected in all matters. The raunie is always a seer of some ability and is usually quite adept.</p>
				<p>The Vistani do not tend fields and so have learned to take what food they can from the land itself. They are able to identify plants and animals with remarkable facility and have little trouble locating sources of drinking water. They are not able hunters, preferring to herd cattle and fish to provide meat. They barter and purchase whatever else they need from villages and are not averse to stealing or rustling when times are lean.</p>
				<p>The Vistani keep to themselves unless they have something to gain by associating with outsiders. They refer to non-Vistani as giorgio, a word that means roughly &#34;one who is not of the blood.&#34; Its usage varies from harshly insulting to mildly patronizing to merely factual. The Vistani as a whole do not hate or dislike giorgio, but they rarely accord them much respect. They simply feel that the giorgio have little to offer besides their coin. To be a giorgio is to be ignorant of the world's mysteries, fearful of the unknown, limited in experience, and dependent on others for survival. To be a Vistana, in their view, is to be none of those things. That the giorgio often fear and hate them is testament to their unenlightened natures. Not every Vistana is capable of being so dispassionate in the face of prejudice, but most Vistani recognize that Vistani are Vistani and giorgio are giorgio, and the two are and always shall be separate. The way things are is the way things are.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, the Vistani have no compunctions about cheating, lying, or stealing in their dealings with the giorgio, if they feel such doubledealings are warranted. Vistani laws apply to the Vistani, and giorgio laws apply to the giorgio. This doesn't mean they won't seek justice for a wrong done to them; it just means they won't be surprised when the wrongdoing occurs.</p>
				<p>Although those who have crossed them might think otherwise, the Vistani are not an evil people. Nor are they a good people. They simply are, in the same way the woods they travel through simply are. The Vistani see themselves as a part of nature in a way that giorgio do not; in fact, another meaning of the word giorgio is &#34;unnatural.&#34; The Vistani and the giorgio may often be at odds, but this does not make one evil or the other good.</p>

					<text type="formattedtext">
						<h>The Evil Eye</h>
						<p>A form of curse unique to the Vistani is the evil eye. Any Vistana can invoke this extraordinary power against an enemy, but females are more adept at this power. A Vistana can use this power up to three times a day.</p>
						<p><b>Evil Eye (Ex) </b>: The evil eye is treated as a gaze attack, save that the Vistana must take a standard action to employ it, and those merely looking at the Vistana are unaffected. The evil eye has one of the following effects, chosen by the Vistana. All saves against these effects are against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the Vistana's Hit Dice + the Vistana's Charisma modifier if the Vistana is a male, or 12 + 1/2 the Vistana's Hit Dice + the Vistana's Charisma modifier if the Vistana is a female.</p>
						<p><i>Paralysis: </i>The target must make a Will save. Those who fail are paralyzed for 1d4+l rounds. Targets who fail their save by more than 4 are paralyzed for two rounds then go into convulsions that last for three rounds. These convulsions cause 1d8 points of damage each round. After the convulsions stop, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Success means the target falls unconscious, though this state more closely resembles sleep; the target can be awakened easily. Failure means the target dies immediately.</p>
						<p><i>Fear: </i>The target must make a Will save. Failure means the target is treated as though under the effects of a fear spell. The effect lasts for 1d4+l rounds.</p>
						<p><i>Domination: </i>The target must make a Will save. Failure means the target is treated as though under the effects of a dominate person spell. The effect lasts for 1d4+l rounds.</p>
						<p><i>Suggestion: </i>The target must make a Will save. Failure means that the target is treated as though under the effects of a suggestion spell. The effect lasts one day, or until the suggested task is completed.</p>

					<name type="string">Curses</name>
					<text type="formattedtext">
						<p>Vistani curses are legendary. Everyone fears the Vistani for their power to curse their foes, and no one crosses them lightly.</p>
						<p>Vistani lay curses using the rules in chapter 3. Vistani curses are especially effective; all fullblood Vistani receive the Voice of Wrath feat for free.</p>
						<p>The Vistani favor certain types of curses over others. The most common Vistani curse is a &#34;Scar,&#34; an embarrassing or frustrating curse that serves as a constant reminder of the folly of injuring the Vistani. Scars are tailored to the individual. For example, a man who prides himself on his wit, and uses it against a Vistana, might find his tongue swelling any time he attempts to be humorous.</p>
						<p>Other common Vistani curses include the Poisoned Carrot, a curse that compels the target to pursue something and at the same time renders the goal impossible to enjoy, and the Doombringer, which causes misfortune to follow the victim everywhere. The most feared Vistani curse is the mishamel, which literally causes the target to melt! The mishamel is reserved for the most heinous crimes. It is a lethal curse that at first causes only perspiration for four days. The sweating is mild on the first day but quickly worsens and becomes profuse and repugnant by the fourth. After the fourth day, the victim can no longer recover hit points naturally and must make a Fortitude save (DC 20) each day or suffer 1 point each of permanent Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage. When the victim's Constitution finally reaches 0, she melts into a puddle of water and cannot be restored to life by any means.</p>
						<p>The Vistani can render their curses even more effective if they possess a focus item. A focus item is an item belonging to the target, such as an article of clothing; a part of the target's body, such as hair or nail clippings; an item the target has handled within the last day; or an effigy or representation of the target. A focus item gives the Vistani a bonus to their curse check. The size of the bonus depends on the quality of the item. A piece of the target's body is worth +4 to the check, while an item belonging to the target is worth +3. An item handled by the target is worth +2, while an effigy is worth only +1.</p>
						<p>The Vistani can withdraw their curses at will but almost never choose to do so. However, they almost always include an escape clause within the curse, as it renders the curse more effective. Besides, they believe few giorgio are clever enough to make use of escape clauses anyway.</p>

						<p>The Vistani language is called the <i>patterna </i>. It is an unusual language, a hodgepodge of various humanoid languages and dialects that conveys meanings less with the words spoken than with the intonation and context of the speech. It has a flowing, rhythmic quality when spoken correctly, something for which few <i>giorgio </i>have the knack. The Vistani &#34;script&#34; consists of symbols known as <i>tralaks </i>. Tralaks are carved into trees or scrawled on stones to convey important information to other passing caravans. All tralaks are descriptive, with each one meant to convey a certain quality about the area in which it was written. One tralak is used to warn Vistani of unfriendly <i>giorgio </i>in the area, for instance, while another is used to mark a source of fresh water. The Vistani have little other use for writing, and on the rare occasion when they must write something particularly long or meaningful, they appropriate the script of a <i>giorgio </i>language.</p>

						<p>Only slightly less fabled than the evil eye is the Vistani power to see into the past and future. Only female Vistani possess this power; Vistani legends hold that men who seek to tell fortunes invite destruction to themselves and their entire caravan. </p>
						<p>The method used by a Vistani seer to tell fortunes is entirely up to the individual. Some Vistani prefer to use crystal balls, while others prefer astrology. The most well-known method of fortunetelling is the tarokka deck, a deck of cards, each bearing a different archetypal image. Each card has a different meaning to the Vistani, and the order and context in which each card is drawn affects that meaning. Tarokka reading is an art form, and the fortunes told by the tarokka can be quite complex and detailed. </p>
						<p>In the end, though, the method used by the seer is only a focus. The true power of fortune-telling lies within the individual, and the accuracy of the fortune depends solely on the skill of the seer. </p>
						<p>There is one limitation of note on the power of the Vistani Sight. The Vistani as a whole are unable to see their own past and future with any clarity. They can see themselves in the past or future indirectly, while telling fortunes for others, but these moments will be vague and indistinct. Great though their powers are, even the Vistani are unable to know their own destiny.</p>
						<p>The Vistani do not like to discuss these matters, but male Vistani with the power of the Sight are born every so often. They are always put to death immediately. A prescient male is known as a Dukkar, and they are believed to be creatures of great evil. The Vistani have several tales of Dukkars who managed to survive to adulthood, and none of them are pleasant.</p>

						<p>Vistani have the uncanny ability to navigate their way through the Mists that surround and pervade Ravenloft. The Vistani simply direct their caravan into a bank of mist and emerge a few minutes later in another. The intervening distance may be hundreds of miles, and the Vistani can freely travel between the islands, the clusters, and the Core. The Vistani can take travelers with them and are usually willing to do so for a price. As the only beings both able to navigate the Mists and willing to profit from the ability, they are free to command almost any price they wish. The voyages through the Mists are always on target, but not always without danger. Many horrors lurk inside the Mists, and the Vistani have become accustomed to fighting them off.</p>

						<p>While the Vistani are often skilled at mundane forms of tracking, more impressive is the Vistani power to mystically track individuals across great distances. Common foci for this power are divining rods and lodestones. The ability appears to be infallible no matter the distance to target. If the Vistani want to find you, they will. Magical protection against detection or location can block this power, but the Vistani are clever enough to use indirect methods if necessary, such as tracking down the target's friends or allies.</p>

						<p>The Vistani are compelled to stay mobile. This is not a mere psychological compulsion, but is an actual physical affliction. Vistani who stay within a mile of any point for longer than a week begin to fall ill. The illness, resembling a flu or fever, is not life threatening or seriously debilitating, but it is only a symptom of the true problem. After 1d6+1 days of illness, the Vistani loses all of her magical powers, and they can never be regained. These Vistani are known as<i> mortu</i>, a word whose closest translation is &#34;living dead.&#34; To the Vistani, the <i>mortu</i> are no longer Vistani, but are instead akin to <i>giorgio</i>. <i>Mortu</i> are despondent and restless at best, mentally unbalanced at worst.</p>

                    <p>Evil comes in many forms, but it is never so dangerous as when it is convenient. Evil can seduce us in ways that Good would never try. Good demands much &#151; patience, compassion, self-sacrifice &#151; and its rewards are often obscure. Evil seems to ask nothing but gladly offers anything we could desire: power, riches, even love. But the gifts of Evil are poisoned fruits, tainted by the very acts undertaken to claim them. Each gift we accept, each moral shortcut we take, leads us further from the light and one step closer to Evil's final reward: our destruction.</p>
                    <p>Unseen by mortals, the Dark Powers sit in judgment of all that occurs within their realm and silently watch countless other worlds as well. Whenever a mortal performs an evil act in Ravenloft, there is a chance that the Dark Powers will respond, both rewarding and punishing the transgressor in a single stroke; this is resolved through a powers check.</p>
                    <p>If a character continues down the path of corruption, the Dark Powers may eventually grant the transgressor her own domain.</p>
                    <p>Mortals may never know what the Dark Powers hope to achieve with their dark gifts. Perhaps the Dark Powers act as caring but overly harsh parents, cursing transgressors to frighten them back onto the path of righteousness, or perhaps the Dark Powers seek to inflame mortals' sins, alternately taunting and teasing the morally weak into bottomless spirals of doom.</p>

                        <h>Making the Powers Check</h>
                        <p>As with curses, the DM should decide whether NPCs who perform evil acts fail their powers checks based simply on whether failure would enhance or detract from the drama of the game.</p>
                        <p>Whenever a player character willingly performs an evil act, the DM should resolve the powers check by making a percentile roll. Mortals have no control over the whims of the Dark Powers; no magic or special ability can ever modify this dice roll.</p>
                        <p>The DM should find the character's transgression on Table 3-6 to determine the chance of failure. If the DM rolls this number or less on the d%, the offending character fails the powers check and moves one stage down the path of corruption. If the DM rolls higher than the listed number, the character succeeds at the powers check; the act has fallen beneath the Dark Powers' concern &#151; this time.</p>
                        <p>The DM can raise or lower the chance of failing a powers check, depending on the character's motivation. If a character performs an evil act for particularly vile reasons, the chance of failure might rise by as much as half. If a character performs a transgression for altruistic purposes &#151; such as casting a necromantic spell to save a life of an ally &#151; the DM may reduce the chance of failure by half.</p>
                        <p>If a character performs an evil act that does not appear on Table 3-6, the DM can use the listed transgressions to judge the chance of failure. Only truly despicable acts should have a chance of failure as high as 10%. Some deeds are so monstrous that they cannot help but attract the attention of the Dark Powers. Anyone who commits one of these Acts of Ultimate Darkness automatically fails the accompanying powers check.</p>
                        <p>Powers checks are intended to enhance the game, to divert the attention of a hoary host of potent unknowns to the actions of the PCs. Use them wisely and where they serve the game. If overused, powers checks can slow the game to a crawl, as the DM meticulously rolls dice every time someone swats a fly or coughs in the vague direction of an old woman. Use the guidelines below to determine when you should incorporate them into the game.</p>

                        <h>Crimes or Acts of Violence</h>
                        <p>These transgressions directly cause others to come to harm. To determine the chance of failure, compare the transgression to the alignment of the victim on Table 3-6. An &#34;Innocent&#34; is any character with the Innocence special quality. (See sidebar, below.)</p>
                        <p><b>Assault, Unprovoked: </b>Violent crimes in which the offender has no intention to kill the victim or cause lasting harm. These attacks are often the result of bigotry, bullying, or petty cruelty. Common examples include muggings, picking a drunken brawl, or striking a child in anger.</p>
                        <p><b>Assault, Grievous: </b>An attack in which the offender intentionally causes lasting harm to the victim. The offender typically has no concern for the victim's life. Common examples include vicious beatings and attempted murder.</p>
                        <p><b>Betrayal, Major: </b>Betrayals include the breaking of trust or of a promise. Breaking a holy vow, however, is considered an unholy act and is detailed below. To be considered a major betrayal, the act must result in lasting harm or death to the betrayed victim. Examples can include a traitorous guard selling the defense plans of his master to assassins, or a merchant reneging on a major contract, bankrupting his business partner's family.</p>
                        <p><b>Betrayal, Minor: </b>A minor betrayal results in minor but lasting effects for the betrayed party. Common examples include breaking up a happy marriage or acts of public humiliation.</p>
                        <p><b>Extortion: </b>Extortion is the criminal act of using the threat of violence to coerce others into giving you something that rightfully belongs to them, or obeying your commands. Common examples include blackmail, armed robbery, and taking hostages.</p>
                        <p><b>Lying: </b>Lying includes telling falsehoods and purposefully withholding truths. The Dark Powers hear every word spoken within their realm, but harmless white lies and tall tales are beneath their concern. To warrant a powers check, the lie must directly result in the hearer coming to harm. Examples might include declining to warn a friend that her drink is poisoned or tricking a herdsman into entering the lair of a fearsome beast to search for his lost sheep.</p>
                        <p><b>Murder, Brutal: </b>Brutal murder is the act of deliberately taking a person's life through painful and sadistic means. Examples might include Vlad Drakov's method of impaling victims on long stakes, or a creature that tries to keep its prey alive for as long as possible while feasting on it. Brutal murders that involve particularly extended suffering may also count as torture.</p>
                        <p><b>Murder, Non-brutal: </b>Non-brutal murder does not include extended suffering &#151; the killer just wants the victim dead. The murder must still be premeditated; killing in self-defense does not warrant a powers check. Vengeance and personal gain are common motives for this brand of murder.</p>
                        <p><b>Theft, Grave Robbing: </b>Raiding crypts and looting corpses defiles the sanctity of the dead. Grave robbing includes violating ancient tombs, unearthing coffins to steal corpses, and looting the bodies of the fallen. In cultures where the tombs of dead are particularly revered, grave robbing may be considered an act of desecration (see below).</p>
                        <p><b>Theft, Major: </b>Theft is the act of taking any item that rightfully belongs to someone else. Whether the theft is major or minor depends on its effect on the victim, not the stolen item's value in gold pieces. Any theft that results in serious hardship for the victim counts as a major theft. Common examples include stealing the meager savings of a peasant family and taking a magic item that the victim needs to keep a curse in check.</p>
                        <p><b>Theft, Minor: </b>Any theft that causes the victim little more than passing aggravation is considered minor. Common examples include stealing an apple from a successful fruit stand or silverware from an aristocrat's pantry.</p>
                        <p><b>Threats of Violence: </b>Intimidation in itself causes little harm and is often beneath the concern of the Dark Powers. To warrant a powers check, the offender must have both the means and intent to follow through with her threats, and the victim must honestly fear for her safety.</p>
                        <p><b>Torture, Routine: </b>Routine torture is the act of inflicting pain to extract information. This is an evil act even when performed toward an ultimate good. Many so-called heroes have been seduced into evil through the misconception that the ends justify the means. Common examples include torturing an enemy to learn the location of her headquarters, battle plans, or even the location of hostages.</p>
                        <p><b>Torture, Sadistic: </b>Sadistic torture is the act of causing intense suffering to derive pleasure. Those who engage in such foul deeds soon draw the attention of the Dark Powers.</p>

                        <h>Unholy Acts</h>
                        <p>Unholy acts are transgressions against a religious code &#151; a particularly serious act for divine spellcasters.</p>
                        <p>As with acts of violence, a character must <i>knowingly </i>violate a religious code to warrant a powers check. A character who has no reasonable way to know of the existence of a religious tenet should not be punished for failing to obey it.</p>
                        <p>To determine the chance of failure, compare the transgression on Table 3-6 to the core alignment of the violated faith. Violating the religious codes of one's own faith, regardless of its alignment, is a particularly serious offense.</p>
                        <p><b>Breaking a Tenet: </b>All religions have certain practices that their faithful are expected to follow. As an example, followers of the Morninglord are expected to sing a short hymn of thanks each morning. Willingly violating one of these rules is considered breaking a tenet.</p>
                        <p><b>Breaking an Oath: </b>Some religions require followers, particularly their clergy, to swear oaths demonstrating their devotion. The clerics of Zhakata, for example, must swear to obey the commands of their high priest at all times, while clerics of Osiris are sworn to protect the sanctity of the dead. Willingly violating such an oath warrants a powers check.</p>
                        <p><b>Breaking a Vow: </b>The clergy of some religions are required to swear lifelong vows in the name of their deity. For example, the priestesses of Belenus in the Shadowlands are considered to be spiritually wed to their god and thus must take vows of chastity. A character who breaks a holy vow must make a powers check, and her religion may enforce additional penalties.</p>
                        <p><b>Defilement: </b>Defilement is the act of causing a sacred place, object, or person to lose its holy blessings. Deeds might include fouling holy water, breaking into a sealed tomb, and even purposefully robbing someone of her Innocence.</p>
                        <p><b>Desecration: </b>Desecration is a more serious form of defilement. Rather than merely causing a sacred object to lose its blessing, desecration actually renders the object unclean in the eyes of its god.Examples include performing a bloody sacrifice on the altar of a good-aligned deity and or casting the <i>desecrate </i>spell.</p>

                        <h>Supernatural Evil</h>
                        <p>Powers checks can also be incurred through trafficking with unholy supernatural forces. With these acts, the chance of failure is determined not by the alignment of the victim, but by the power of the occult forces the transgressor calls. Unlike in Unholy acts, the transgressor does not need to know that a form of magic is considered profane to warrant a powers check.</p>
                        <p><b>Laying a Curse: </b>See &#34;Making the Curse Check&#34; on page 81. The curse's severity determines the chance of failure.</p>
                        <p><b>Casting an Evil or Necromantic Spell: </b>Some spells call on forces that mortals were not meant to wield. The &#34;Altered Magic&#34; section later in this chapter details which forms of magic require powers checks. The chance of failure is equal to the effective spell level of the spell being cast. Note that some special abilities, such as the Empower Spell feat, can alter a spell's effective level. If a spell has both the &#34;evil&#34; and &#34;necromancy&#34; descriptors, the chance of failure is doubled.</p>
                        <p><b>Using an Evil Magic Item: </b>Some magic items have one or more special abilities that mirror the effects of spells that incur a powers check. Using such a special ability incurs a powers check as if the user had cast the spell. For example, whenever a character uses a sword of <i>life stealing </i>to bestow a negative level on a foe, the wielder must make a powers check as if she had cast <i>energy drain </i>.</p>
                        <p>The end of the &#34;Altered Magic&#34; section lists all of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>magic items that require powers check to use, bear, or craft.</p>
                        <p><b>Bearing an Evil Magic Item: </b>Some magic items are so infused with evil that a character runs a risk of corruption merely by keeping the item in her possession. This is most often the case with intelligent evil items or those with powers that are continually in effect, such as a darkskull. A character with this item in her possession must make a powers check once a week. The chance of failure is equal to that of the item's highest-level spell effect.</p>
                        <p><b>Crafting an Evil Magic Item: </b>Magic Items hold the potential to be powerful tools of evil. An evil spell is cast once and is then gone, like a bee losing its sting. A magic item with evil abilities can sting again and again, spreading evil long after its creator is gone. These items can be created only by calling on evil forces. Powers checks for Crafting evil magic items often carry significant chances of failure. First, add the total chance of failure for all prerequisite spells. If the magic item is reusable (as opposed to one-use items like scrolls, potions, or magic arrows), add 10% of the prerequisite experience cost.</p>
                        <p>For example, for a cleric, the prerequisites for Crafting a <i>hand of glory </i>include <i>animate dead </i>, a 3rd-level spell, and 288 XP. The cleric's chance of failing a powers check for creating a hand of glory is thus 31% (3% + 28%). Creating some magic items can incur a powers check with a chance of failure well over 100%; consider crafting such an item to be an Act of Ultimate Darkness.</p>
                        <p>If a metamagic feat augments a character's spell that results in a powers check, the level of that metamagic feat adds to the level of the spell in question for the purposes of determining the chance of failing a powers check. Characters who use feats are going out of their way to make something happen; using them to aid heinous sorceries is all the more noticeable to the Dark Powers.</p>

                    <h>The Effects of Failure</h>
                    <p>No person is born evil. All player characters are assumed to enter a Ravenloft campaign with &#34;clean&#34; souls &#151; they have never failed any powers checks, and the forces of corruption have no claim on their spirits. If the player wants, and if her character meets the prerequisites, a hero can enter the campaign with her Innocence intact (see sidebar). Alternatively, if the player and DM agree, a player character could enter the campaign having already failed one or more powers checks. Such a character might be struggling against some dark inner nature, or she might now be on a quest for redemption from the mistakes of her earlier years.</p>
                    <p>If a character fails a powers check, the Dark Powers respond with gifts of darkness &#151; and the character moves one stage toward corruption. At each stage, the corrupted character receives an occult boon and an accompanying curse. The gifts and curses bestowed by the Dark Powers are inexorably tied: a rogue who gains low-light vision might also suffer from light sensitivity, inflicting -1 penalties to attack rolls in bright daylight; a monk who receives a bonus to her natural armor might grow a thick, scaly hide. As with the curses offered earlier in this chapter, these curses apply OR modifiers whenever their effects are noticed. Curses arising from failed powers checks should manifest at least as often as the accompanying gift comes into play.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Powers tailor all of their gifts and curses to the victim. As a rule, the Dark Powers' gifts tend to make it easier for a corrupted character to repeat her transgressions but harder to conceal her crimes.</p>
                    <p>In the initial stages of corruption, when redemption is still at hand, both the gifts and the curses bestowed by the Dark Powers tend to be minor and easily concealed. In later stages, however, the trap starts to close. The curses gain strength, forcing the corrupted character to rely more heavily on her dark gifts &#151; abilities that often require more powers checks to use.</p>

                    <h>Innocence</h>
                    <p>Innocence represents a soul completely free of the taint of evil. Any character can choose to be Innocent at 1st level so long as she meets the prerequisites. Innocence is a supernatural quality. It is not a feat, because it is easily lost. Indeed, although all people are born Innocent, most lose their purity long before they leave childhood.</p>
                    <p><b>Prerequisites: </b>You must be humanoid and of good alignment and must have never committed any act worthy of a powers check, regardless of the success or failure of that check. <b></b></p>
                    <p><b>Benefits: </b>Evil is repelled by your inner light. You get a +3 divine bonus to all saving throws against any spell effect or supernatural ability that either requires a powers check or is used by an evil creature.</p>
                    <p><b>Drawbacks: </b>Your naivete leaves you with a -2 competence penalty to Horror saves and Insight checks. Evil clerics can turn &#151; but never destroy &#151; you just as they would rebuke undead. Spells in Ravenloft cannot directly target moral alignment, but some can target Innocence.</p>
                    <p><b>Losing Innocence: </b>You immediately lose all effects of Innocence if you ever fail to meet the above prerequisites or if you ever suffer a moderate or major Horror or Madness effect. You may also voluntarily lose your Innocence at any time. Once lost, however, Innocence can never be regained.</p>

                    <h>The Path of Corruption</h>
                    <p><b>Related:</b></p>
                    <p>The path from Innocence to the final damnation of a darklord is distressingly short &#151; a mere seven steps &#151; and all too easy to traverse. Each stage is listed with a sampling of dread gifts the Dark Powers can bestow. The DM can use the Suggested Spell-like Abilities sidebar to select powers to model a corrupted character's gradual transformation into a creature of the night. Each stage also bestows a curse, each of increasing severity. If the DM carefully considers how these powers and curses will interact, she can transform what may appear to be a collection of random modifiers into an evocative descent into darkness.</p>
                    <p>Three example paths demonstrate a few of the many different ways the path of corruption might manifest. The <i>Path of the Ringleader </i>applies to a character who prefers to linger in the shadows, ordering his minions to do his dirty work for him. The <i>Path of the Brute </i>applies to a cruel and unsubtle bully. The <i>Path of the Coward </i>applies to a character who regularly abandons his friends and allies in the face of danger to save himself. A DM may wish to create a unique path of his own if a character is especially fiendish in an unconventional way.</p>
                    <h>Stage One: The Caress</h>
                    <p>The Dark Powers reward a character's first touch of evil with a minor boon. The character also gains an embarrassing curse. A corrupted character can usually conceal any physical deformities created at this stage with little effort &#151; gloves, tinted glasses, and so on.</p>
                    <p><b>Example Rewards</b></p>
                    <list>

                    <h>Stage Two: The Enticement</h>
                    <p>Once the corrupted character demonstrates a willingness to return to her evil ways, the Dark Powers grant her greater assistance in her evil endeavors. They temper this, however, with a frustrating curse.</p>

                    <p><b>Path of the Ringleader: </b>The character develops a ravenous appetite for vermin. On any day the character eats at least a handful of spiders, he gains venomous saliva; a successful bite attack carries the effects of Medium-size spider venom (see the Dungeon Master's <i>Guide </i>).</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Brute: </b>The character grows larger and more menacing. His ability score bonuses increase to +4 Strength and +2 Dexterity, but he suffers a -2 Charisma penalty.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Coward: </b>The character gains a +4 bonus to Move Silently checks whenever moving on all fours. The character grows thick pads on his hands and feet, making them resemble paws</p>
                    <h>Stage Three: The Invitation</h>
                    <p>The corrupted character has continued in her evil ways, and any hope of redemption is quickly fading. The Dark Powers now offer a powerful boon but also bestow a troublesome curse. A character who proceeds this far down the path of corruption has difficulty turning back.</p>

                    <p><b>Path of the Ringleader: </b>The character can cast summon swarm twice a day as a supernatural ability. The swarm spews out of the character's nose and throat and crawls back inside his body when the spell's duration ends. The swarm always starts centered on the character, but he can move it as a druid. The character also develops a ravenous appetite for rotting meat; if he does not eat at least 10 pounds of meat each day, he suffers biting pains (and 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage) as the swarm begins to devour him from the inside out.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Brute: </b>The character's Strength bonus rises to +8, and he gains a +2 bonus to Constitution, but whenever he is angered he automatically flies into a mad Rage (as the horror effect). The character has grown at least a foot in height.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Coward: </b>When running on all fours, the character's bonus to speed rises to +30, plus he gains a +4 bonus to Jump checks. However, he finds that fear grips him all the more often; he suffers a -2 penalty to all Will saves.</p>
                    <h>Stage Four: The Embrace</h>
                    <p>The corrupted character's evil deeds mark her as a true villain. The Dark Powers respond with a major gift, but the accompanying dangerous curse can create serious mental or physical changes. The corrupted character can no longer live the normal life she started with. If the corrupted character is a PC, the player may occasionally lose control of her character's actions (as in the case of afflicted lycan-thropy, for example).</p>

                    <p><b>Path of the Ringleader: </b>The character can summon swarm four times a day. Additionally, twice a day the character can will his symbiotic minions to spew forth and spin a web as a supernatural ability. Vermin are visible rippling beneath the character's skin; he suffers penalties of -4 Constitution and -2 Charisma.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Brute: </b>The character is massive for his race, but he appears distinctly degenerate. His ability score modifiers increase to +12 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, -4 Charisma.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Coward: </b>The character becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, transforming into a jackal (use the Monster Manual dog) whenever he fails a fear save.</p>
                    <h>Stage Five: The Creature</h>
                    <p>By now, the corrupted character's evil has reshaped her into a creature of the night. For characters who proceed this far down the path of corruption, redemption often comes only in death. The Dark Powers now bestow even greater gifts but strike the character down with a lethal curse.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Powers' curse never destroys the corrupted character, though she may wish it had. At the DM's discretion, a player character who falls this far from the light may be removed from the player's control, becoming a villainous NPC.</p>

                    <p><b>Path of the Ringleader: </b>Once per day, the character can expel his vermin with the effects of an insect plague spell. The character is a walking hive for his minions; he grows cadaverous, his skin diseased. The character's ability score penalty increases to -6 Constitution and -8 Charisma. The character must rely on his dark gifts to keep his henchman obedient.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Brute: </b>The character's ability score modifiers increase to +14 Strength, +8 Dexterity, +8 Constitution, -8 Intelligence, -4 Wisdom, and -4 Charisma. The character is a hulking, brutal creature resembling an ogre.</p>
                    <p><b>Path of the Coward: </b>The character can assume jackal form at will, gaining the Improved Control Shape feat. Despite this, the character still transforms whenever he fails a Fear save. To make matters worse, the character suffers a -6 penalty to all Will saves.</p>
                    <h>Stage Six: The Darklord</h>
                    <p>With his final act of evil, the corrupted character proves himself beyond redemption and seals his fate. The Dark Powers grant the corrupted character his own domain &#151; a prison, molded in his own image, from which he will never escape. Most new darklords rule over small Islands of Terror or physical islands in one of the Core's seas. Hand-in-hand with the new domain comes the darklord's curse: the object of his most desperate desire is placed within his sight but forever just beyond his grasp. Darklords have widely differing abilities and weaknesses; indeed, the Dark Powers seem to reward captivating personalities with greater power. A few powers known to be common to many darklords are provided here.</p>
                    <p><i>Secrets of the Dread Domains </i>offer a comprehensive gallery of darklords, providing extensive examples for DMs who want to design their own. Player characters who become darklords automatically become NPCs run by the DM.</p>
                    <h>Common Powers</h>
                    <list>
                        <li> Closing the Borders: Darklords are imprisoned within their domains but can force others to share their fate. Darklords can close the borders of their domains at will, creating supernatural barriers of immense power. No mortal magic can pierce a closed domain border. In some domains, the Mists themselves rise up to close the borders &#151; anyone who enters the Mists becomes disoriented and eventually finds herself wandering back into the domain. The manifestations of closed borders are often a reflection of the darklord's personality. A few darklords are said to be unable to close their borders, as part of their darklord's curse.</li>
                        <li> Sinkhole of Evil: All darklords emit their own sinkhole of evil. Ethereal resonance within a 300- foot radius of a darklord rises by one rank. See the sidebar on page 94.</li>
                        <li> Turn Resistance: All undead darklords receive a bonus to their turn resistance equal to +1 or their Wisdom bonus, whichever is greater.</li>
                        <li> Detect Disruption: A darklord can sense the disruption created by a paladin within his domain with a successful Scry check. See chapter 2.</li>
                        <li> Persistence: Some darklords cease to age when they receive their domain. For some, the aging process simply slows, while others continue to age normally.</li>
                    </list>
                    <h>Redemption</h>
                    <p>The road to damnation is swift but not certain. It is possible for a character to recoil from her evil deeds and, with time and toil, return to the light. If a character is truly penitent, the Dark Powers may subtly guide the corrupted character's fate to test her repentance. To escape the effects of a powers check, the corrupted character must encounter an event echoing the one that resulted in her failed powers check. This time around, the corrupted character must choose the righteous path. For example, if a character failed a powers check for killing a group of helpless captives, she must do all that she can to protect the lives of the next group of helpless captives she encounters.</p>
                    <p>It is no mean feat to scrub corruption out of the soul, however. The character must repeat the process a number of times equal to the chance of failure 1 of the original powers check. If the character accomplishes this, she can attempt a new powers check at the same chance of failure. If the character succeeds at this check, the Dark Powers loosen their grip on her soul; she retreats one stage from the path of corruption. (A corrupted character at the Embrace would retreat to the Invitation, and so forth.) Characters can possibly work their way back to &#34;Clean,&#34; but they can never reclaim Innocence. Acts of Ultimate Darkness cannot be redeemed.</p>
                    <p>It may even be possible for a darklord to redeem his blackened soul &#151; but in all the known history of Ravenloft, not one ever has.</p>

                    <p>A cleric uses a magical <i>glyph </i>to seal an ancient crypt, trapping the evil within. A necromancer toils in a moonlit graveyard, <i>animating </i>a horde of undead minions. Many characters in Ravenloft possess the power to twist or even shatter the laws of nature for their own ends. Magic allows mortals to control men's minds, smite their foes with supernatural energies, or even grant life to the dead. In short, magic allows mortals to play at being gods.</p>
                    <p>This section details the limitations and consequences of using magic under the cold gaze of the Dark Powers.</p>
                    <h>Who Knows This?</h>
                    <p>Spellcasters native to Ravenloft have learned most of the limitations of magic through generations of research. Folklore is likewise filled with warnings against the risks of tampering with the laws of nature, though these superstitions often exaggerate or distort the truth. If a spell effect &#151; such as detecting moral alignment &#151; simply does not function in Ravenloft, most Spellcasters believe that the effect is inherently impossible. They may even scoff openly at the thought that such things may be possible in &#34;other lands.&#34;</p>
                    <p>Spellcasters from other worlds have to learn how magic has been warped through trial and error. If you are playing an &#34;outlander&#34; spellcasting hero in Ravenloft, you may want to skip the rest of this chapter, preserving the mystery and allowing you to learn magic's secrets along with your character.</p>

                    <h>General Guidelines</h>
                    <p>All spell effects and supernatural powers in Ravenloft must obey the following guidelines. Use these guidelines when introducing new magic into Ravenloft. Of course, a DM can also fine-tune these rules to foster a more horrific atmosphere in any setting. </p>
                    <p>Specific spell alterations follow this section</p>
                    <h>Abjuration</h>
                    <p>These spells would normally return an extraplanar creature to its home plane, but the Dark Powers do not allow such easy escape from their realm. Instead, abjuration spells transport the creature to a random location (selected by the DM) within Ravenloft (but not across closed domain borders).</p>
                    <h>Astral</h>
                    <p>The Dark Powers severely constrict Ravenloft's connection to other planes. Although astral matter can be drawn into Ravenloft, any spell that would normally project a subject into the Astral Plane automatically fails. However, see &#34;Teleportation.&#34;</p>
                    <h>Closed Domain Borders</h>
                    <p>No amount of mortal magic can overcome the effects of a closed domain border. However, a creature's natural or extraordinary abilities may render it immune to the effects of a specific border closure. </p>
                    <p><i>Example:</i> Creatures without a Constitution score have no biological processes, making them immune to poison by their very nature; thus they can pass through poison-based closed border effects without harm</p>
                    <h>Conjuration</h>
                    <p>Conjured creatures are more difficult to control in Ravenloft. In the round that the creature appears, the creature can attempt a Will save with a -2 penalty against your spell. Success indicates that the creature escapes your control and can act freely. Generally, it will seek to return to its home dimension. </p>
                    <p><b>Calling:</b> All calling spells contain an implicit pact between you and the outsider or elemental you conjure: when the creature has performed its assigned task, it is normally free to return to its plane of origin. Yet the Dark Powers severely restrict escape to other planes, preventing a called creature from leaving Ravenloft unless it can find an exit, like any other creature. When the called creature attempts to leave Ravenloft after completing its task and discovers it cannot, the pact is broken. You lose all control over the creature, which is likely to feel betrayed. </p>
                    <p>A called creature's behavior once a broken pact frees it from your control depends on the creature's alignment. Evil or neutral creatures might try to destroy you in retaliation. </p>
                    <p>If you attempt to call an elemental, there is a 20% chance that the spell produces a dread elemental instead. Dread elementals will be detailed in Denizens of Darkness. DMs without access to that accessory can treat dread elementals as standard Monster Manual elementals, with the following changes: dread elementals have the Mists descriptor, and their moral alignment is always evil. </p>
                    <p>Using a calling spell to conjure an evil creature requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Summoning:</b> Summoning spells are significantly warped by the severe restrictions on planar travel in Ravenloft. Rather than summoning outsiders for assistance, you conjure creatures taken from the surrounding region. Thus, only creatures found in the domain in which this spell is cast can be summoned. </p>
                    <p>Summoned creatures in Ravenloft do not use the outsider template. Thus, <i>summon monster I</i> would summon a dire rat, not a fiendish dire rat. Attempts to summon an outsider like a succubus or kyton automatically fail unless such a creature happens to be in the domain. Attempts to summon elementals automatically produce dread elementals. </p>
                    <p>Most domains, such as those of the Core, have rich ecologies where many of the creatures listed under the summon spells can be found. Some wretched domains have extremely limited or even nonexistent ecologies. If you choose a creature to summon that is not present in the domain, the spell fails. Chapter 4 lists each domain with its ecology: </p>
                    <p><i>Full Ecology:</i> This is always followed by a list of climate/terrain conditions found in the domain. Any creature native to these conditions is usually available to be summoned. </p>
                    <p><i>Sparse Ecology:</i> The domain has an extremely limited ecology; this is usually the case in domains with blasted or alien landscapes. Only vermin and oozes can be summoned. </p>
                    <p><i>No Ecology:</i> There are no living creatures within the domain. Only Mist creatures can be summoned. Summoned creatures return from whence they came at the end of the spell's duration, as described in the <i>Player's Handboo</i>k. Because they never cross planar borders, no pact is broken, and the creatures do not turn against the caster. </p>
                    <p>If you summon creatures under the influence of the darklord, the creatures still appear, but the influence modifiers still apply (see &#34;Enchantment&#34;). </p>
                    <p><b>Mists:</b> Elementals or outsiders with the Mists descriptor are conjured from the Mists themselves &#151; the very planar fabric of the Realm of Dread. These creatures can be summoned in any domain.</p>
                    <h>Detecting Alignment</h>
                    <p>The Dark Powers shield evil in their realm. Any attempt to detect a target's moral alignment automatically fails</p>
                    <p>Some spells can or must be defined as affecting a specific alignment (chaotic evil, neutral good, and so on) at the time of casting. In these cases, you specify only the intended target's ethical alignment. The spell then targets any applicable subject with the chosen aspect in its ethical alignment. However, these spells can be specifically targeted to affect Innocents. </p>
                    <p><i>Example:</i> A spell defined to affect &#34;neutral&#34; creatures would affect neutral good, true neutral, and neutral evil creatures equally. </p>
                    <p>Magic effects that detect alignment only in an indirect fashion (such as <i>protection from evil</i> or a paladin's smite evil ability) often still work normally.</p>
                    <h>Death</h>
                    <p>Spells with the death descriptor harm their target by directly attacking its life force &#151; its soul, in essence. In Ravenloft, casting such a spell requires a powers check. Targets killed by death spells often return from the grave as undead creatures.</p>
                    <h>Divination</h>
                    <p>Divination is notoriously untrustworthy in Ravenloft, except in the hands of the Vistani. Attempts to peer into the future or to petition one's god for guidance often produce misleading results or fail completely. It might be said that the Dark Powers want mortals to make their own choices, for good or ill.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Powers shield undead creatures in their realm. Such creatures can always attempt a Will save to avoid any spell effect that would reveal their undead nature. </p>
                    <p><b>Scrying:</b> Scrying other locations, as with the <i>arcane eye</i> spell, is more reliable but carries its own risks. These spells normally create an invisible sensor. In Ravenloft, they create a visible, ghostly sensor resembling the caster's own equivalent sensory organ. Any creature can detect the sensor by making a Spot or Scry check against DC 16, due to its fine size. </p>
                    <p>The caster may be vulnerable to attacks sent through the sensor. Visual sensors can channel gaze attacks, and auditory sensors can channel sonic attacks. A vampire that notices the ghostly eye created by <i>clairvoyance</i> can target the caster with its domination gaze, for example.</p>
                    <h>Enchantment</h>
                    <p>If you force a compelled creature to commit an act requiring a powers check, it is you who must make the powers check, not your unwilling minion. </p>
                    <p>Some darklords have the ability to control certain creatures within their domains. If you attempt to control (either through charm or compulsion) the mind of a creature under the influence of a darklord, or try to free a creature from a darklord's influence, that creature stacks the lord's Charisma bonus with its own Will save bonus. No creature under the influence of a darklord can be directed to attack that darklord; if ordered to do so, the pitiful creature may resolve its confusion by fleeing the scene. </p>
                    <p><i>Example:</i> A vampiric darklord may be able to control the wolves in his domain at will. If you attempt to charm or compel any wolves in the vampire's domain, those wolves add the darklord's Charisma bonus to their Will saves to resist your spell.</p>
                    <h>Ethereal</h>
                    <p>Any spell effect that would normally transport a subject to the Ethereal Plane actually leads to the Near Ethereal, the borderland between Ravenloft and the Deep Ethereal. A character who shifts to the Near Ethereal is still within the Realm of Dread and cannot travel deeper into the Ethereal Plane. </p>
                    <p>The Near Ethereal is known by many names in Ravenloft. It is the Other Side in Mordent, the Gray Realm in Darkon, and is called the Spirit World in many mystical traditions. The Near Ethereal is a land of lingering memories and of the dead, where incorporeal undead linger, unable or unwilling to move on to their final rest. </p>
                    <p>Strong emotions can take on tangible form in the Near Ethereal. See the &#34;Sinkholes of Evil&#34; sidebar for more details.</p>
                    <h>Evil</h>
                    <p>The effects of spells with the evil descriptor automatically require a powers check, but their effects are usually enhanced. As an example, an evil spell may get a +1 bonus to its effective spell level. <b>OUTDATED</b></p>
                    <h>Extraplanar</h>
                    <p>Although Ravenloft is located in the Deep Ethereal, by fiat of the Dark Powers all spell effects function as though it were on the Material Plane.</p>
                    <p>Creatures originally from the Material Plane are considered to be on their &#34;home plane.&#34; In Ravenloft, only outsiders and elementals should be treated as extraplanar.</p>
                    <h>Illusion (Shadow)</h>
                    <p>Ravenloft has strong ties to the Plane of Shadow. Spells that utilize shadow material are more effective, but dangerous to cast. </p>
                    <p>If you use shadow material to create illusionary creatures, objects, or forces, those conjurations are 20% stronger than the spell indicates. If you use shadow energy to create an illusory spell, damaging spells deal 20% more damage than listed, and nondamaging effects have an extra 20% chance of working. </p>
                    <p>However, at the end of the spell's duration, you must attempt a Will save against your own spell. If you fail this saving throw, any shadow creations that have not been dispelled spontaneously transform into true shadows (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>), with total HD equal to the effective spell level. These shadows are free willed.</p>
                    <h>Mind-Affecting</h>
                    <p>The Dark Powers shield undead creatures within their realm. Undead creatures with Intelligence scores can choose to project false thoughts to those who use mental powers on them</p>
                    <p>An undead creature can project these false thoughts automatically (without need for a saving throw), but if the creature is unaware of the attempt to read its mind or caught by surprise, it cannot hide its true thoughts. </p>
                    <p>Typically, undead creatures project peaceful, friendly, and reassuring thoughts to lull the caster's suspicions. The creature can allow access to its true thoughts, if it so desires.</p>
                    <p> If you attempt to contact the alien mind of an aberration, an elemental, an ooze, an outsider, a plant, a darklord, or a creature suffering from any Madness effect, you must make a Madness save. (Druids and clerics with the Plant domain are exempt when contacting plants.)</p>
                    <h>Necromancy</h>
                    <p>Necromantic spells disrupt the natural cycles of life and death. The only necromantic spells that do not require powers checks are those that are purely defensive, do not create or enhance undead creatures, and do not require the manipulation of your life force or that of another subject. (Example: the <i>deathwatch</i> spell.) </p>
                    <p><i>Note:</i> In Ravenloft, it is often easier to <i>create</i> undead creatures but harder to <i>control</i> them. </p>
                    <p>Necromantic spells that require powers checks often feature enhanced effects. The few that do not require powers checks often carry risks not found when cast in other worlds.</p>
                    <h>Teleportation</h>
                    <p>The magic of teleportation typically involves instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Although Ravenloft's restricted planar ties would seem to render this process impossible, the Dark Powers do allow teleportation spells to function within their realm &#151; but only under their own rules. In Ravenloft, teleportation is instantaneous transportation through the Mists. </p>
                    <p>For most purposes, each domain within Ravenloft should be considered a separate plane. Spells below 6th level cannot transport creatures or objects across domain borders. Powerful spells (such as <i>teleport without error</i>) can accomplish this, but no spell can transport anyone or anything across a closed domain border or out of Ravenloft.</p>
                    <h>Weather</h>
                    <p>Some darklords can control the weather in their domains, or at least exert influence on it. Spell effects cannot override the darklord's control of the weather. The darklord may choose to let the spell work normally, but he will be aware that this spell was cast, even if he takes no action to thwart it.</p>

                    <p>Any aspect of a <i>Player's Handbook</i> spell not altered in the following listings functions normally in Ravenloft. </p>
                    <p><b>Animal Friendship:</b> See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Animal Messenger: </b>See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Animal Trance:</b> See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Animate Dead:</b> See Necromancy. This spell works almost too well in Ravenloft. Normally, the highest number of undead skeletons or zombies you can animate with a single casting is equal to your caster level in HD. When clerics cast this spell in Ravenloft, however, this rises to twice their caster level in HD. </p>
                    <p>You may add as many HD to your undead creations as you desire during casting, as long as the total does not exceed twice your caster level. </p>
                    <p>The maximum number of undead you can control at any one time (including multiple castings) is 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. </p>
                    <p>Remember that the HD of an undead creature affects its resistance to turning and rebuking attempts. Furthermore, creatures whose HD exceed your caster level can attempt a Will save to break free of your control. </p>
                    <p>In Ravenloft, casting this spell requires no material component, but it does require a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Antimagic Field:</b> See Closed Domain Borders. </p>
                    <p><b>Antipathy:</b> See Detecting Alignment. </p>
                    <p><b>Arcane Eye: </b>See Divination (Scrying). </p>
                    <p><b>Astral Projection:</b> See Astral. </p>
                    <p><b>Atonement: </b>This spell cannot remove the effects of a failed powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Awaken: </b>If you awaken a plant to humanlike intelligence, it slowly and inexorably absorbs the evil taint of the Realm of Dread from the very soil. Once a month, the awakened plant must succeed at a Will save (DC = the number of months that have passed since it was awakened) or have its moral alignment permanently shift to evil. </p>
                    <p><b>Banishment:</b> See Abjuration and Extraplanar. Any outsider or elemental targeted by this spell makes its Will saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p>
                    <p><b>Bestow Curse:</b> Curses are very powerful in Ravenloft. The stronger the curse, the less likely it is that a mere spell can suspend it. You may invent your own curse, as mentioned in the Player's Handbook. Such curses should be designed using the guidelines for inventing curses presented earlier in this chapter. </p>
                    <p>Curses you invent may be of any severity but must include an escape clause. The curses in the spell listing are considered to be of dangerous severity. </p>
                    <p>After you craft your curse, the DM assigns its severity. This severity inflicts a penalty to the subject's saving throw; these modifiers can be found under &#34;Lifting Curses,&#34; earlier in this chapter. </p>
                    <p>Casting bestow curse requires a powers check. The chance of failure is determined by the severity of the curse, not the effective spell level. </p>
                    <p><b>Binding:</b> See Detecting Alignment. </p>
                    <p><b>Blasphemy:</b> See Abjuration, Extraplanar. A creature banished to another domain cannot come within sight of you for one full day. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Blink:</b> See Ethereal. </p>
                    <p><b>Break Enchantment: </b>See Enchantment if you attempt to use this spell to free a creature from the influence of a darklord. If you use this spell to dispel a curse, the subject must make a successful Will save to temporarily be rid of the curse's effects; the duration of relief is only 10 minutes per caster level. This is enough time to discard cursed magic items. </p>
                    <p><b>Calm Animals:</b> See Enchantment. All creatures under the influence of a darklord are allowed saving throws to resist the effects of this spell. </p>
                    <p><b>Charm Monster: </b>See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Charm Person or Animal: </b>See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Chill Touch: </b>If a living creature targeted by this spell fails its Fortitude save, it suffers 1 point of temporary Strength damage and 1 point of temporary Constitution damage. If the Fortitude save succeeds, a living target still suffers 1 point of temporary Strength damage. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Circle of Death:</b> Creatures killed by this spell must succeed at a Will save or spontaneously animate as skeletons under your control. Casting this spell requires a powers check. Note: See animate dead for the total number of undead creatures you can have under your control at any one time. </p>
                    <p><b>Circle of Doom:</b> If the targets of this spell fail their Fortitude saves, they also suffer 1 point of temporary Strength damage. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Clairaudience/Clairvoyance:</b> See Divination (Scrying). A &#34;familiar&#34; place is one you have visited personally. If you have observed the location only through indirect means, including scrying, there is a 50% chance that the spell will fail. A darklord is considered familiar with the entirety of his or her domain. An &#34;obvious&#34; place denotes one directly connected to the scene before you. If you see a door, you can cast the spell on the other side of the door, but you cannot cast it around a corner and through the door. This spell can reach only across a single Mistbound region and does not work directly on the Mists. </p>
                    <p><b>Clone: </b>If you grow a duplicate while the original still lives, the Dark Powers infuse the clone's flesh with its own life force, mirroring that of the original at the time the piece of flesh was taken. The duplicate's moral alignment is always evil, and the clone will be obsessed with the goal of destroying the original so it can replace her. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Command: </b>See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Commune: </b>See Divination. This spell simply does not function in Ravenloft. </p>
                    <p><b>Commune with Nature:</b> The radius of effect never extends beyond domain borders. You may attempt to sense the general location of the darklord as one of your three facts, so long as he is within range. If you select this option, however, the darklord gets a Will save to avoid detection. Whether or not the darklord succeeds at this saving throw, he instantly becomes aware of your general location. </p>
                    <p><b>Consecrate: </b>This spell works normally in Ravenloft. If consecrate is cast within a sinkhole of evil, the two effects counteract. If the area of the sinkhole exceeds the area of the spell effect, then the region not covered by the spell is still a sinkhole of evil with the original modifiers. </p>
                    <p><b>Contact Other Plane:</b> See Divination, Mind- Affecting. This spell opens a mental conduit to the darklord. Duration is reduced to 1 minute per 2 caster levels. You know only that you have contacted a powerful, malevolent force. The darklord need not answer truthfully; in fact, he does not have to answer at all.</p>
                    <p>The DM should roleplay any conversation between you and the darklord. </p>
                    <p>Neither party can make attacks through this mental contact, but the lord discovers your approximate location, to within two miles. The darklord may decide to humor your questions, or he may opt to dispatch minions to hunt you down. </p>
                    <p>Contacting a mind so filled with evil can easily drive a person insane. You must make a Madness save, using the Mental Contact guidelines to determine DC. Make this save in lieu of the Intelligence check discussed in the spell description. A darklord can willingly project thoughts of evil and despair at you. If he does this, add +2 to the DC of the Madness save. </p>
                    <p><b>Contagion:</b> Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Control Plants:</b> See Enchantment. Some darklords may have influence over plant creatures. Control Undead: All undead creatures with more than 3 HD add a +2 bonus to their Will save to resist control. This spell cannot affect darklords. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Control Weather:</b> See Closed Domain Borders, Weather. </p>
                    <p><b>Control Winds:</b> See Closed Domain Borders, Weather. </p>
                    <p><b>Create Greater Undead:</b> As create undead. Note that many greater undead are template creatures and thus may still posses many or all of the memories and abilities they had while alive. </p>
                    <p><b>Create Undead:</b> Add a +1 bonus to your effective caster level when casting this spell. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Curse Water</b>: Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Daylight:</b> Although the light from this spell is as bright as sunlight, it is not considered to be true sunlight. Therefore, creatures affected by true sunlight (such as vampires) suffer no ill effects from daylight beyond those in the spell description.</p>
                    <p>Death Knell: The effects of this spell last for 20 minutes per HD of the target creature. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p>Deathwatch: Undead creatures with Intelligence scores may attempt a Will save to avoid detection as &#34;undead.&#34; If the save is successful, the creature reads as &#34;fighting off death&#34; if unwounded or &#34;fragile&#34; if wounded. This effect holds even if the creature has an obviously undead appearance. </p>
                    <p><b>Demand:</b> See Enchantment. </p>
                    <p><b>Desecrate:</b> The modifiers applied by this spell stack with those applied by a sinkhole of evil. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Destruction:</b> If the subject of this spell succeeds at her Fortitude save but is still killed by the secondary damage, she may return as a type of incorporeal undead (of the DM's choice) with total HD equal to the slain victim's character level. This incorporeal undead is not under your control. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Detect Evil:</b> See Detecting Alignment. </p>
                    <p><b>Detect Good:</b> See Detecting Alignment. </p>
                    <p><b>Detect Thoughts:</b> See Mind-Affecting. </p>
                    <p><b>Detect Undead:</b> Undead creatures receive a Will save to avoid detection. The aura strength you detect is based on the number of undead creatures that fail their Will saves. Example: Gennifer casts detect undead on a dark pit, where lurks a group of 12 zombies. Only 4 of these zombies fail their saving throw. Thus, Gennifer detects only a &#34;moderate&#34; aura of undeath. </p>
                    <p><b>Dictim: </b>See Extraplanar. </p>
                    <p><b>Dimensional Anchor:</b> The target of this spell is unable to cross any domain borders or enter the Mists for the spell's duration. </p>
                    <p><b>Dimension Door:</b> See Teleportation. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you are trapped in the Mists, not the Astral, but may attempt to return as described in the Player's Handbook. </p>
                    <p><b>Discern Location:</b> This spell works normally, except that it never reveals on what plane any subject in Ravenloft lies. You are aware that this information has been left strangely &#34;blank.&#34; This is true even when the spell is cast on worlds beyond the Realm of Dread. Dismissal: See Abjuration and Extraplanar. If the extraplanar creature fails its saving throw, there is a 50% chance that the creature is teleported to a random location in Ravenloft. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. </p>
                    <p><b>Dispel Evil: </b>See Abjuration. The spell does dispel enchantments cast by evil creatures and evil spells. However, it is generally ineffective against curses of vengeance (see &#34;Curses&#34;). </p>
                    <p><b>Dispel Good: </b>As dispel evil. </p>
                    <p><b>Dispel Magic:</b> See Closed Domain Borders. This spell cannot dispel curses of vengeance. </p>
                    <p><b>Divination:</b> The base chance of a correct divination remains unchanged, but you are not made aware if the dice roll fails. Instead, the Dark Powers provide an answer that is purposefully misleading and possibly malicious. </p>
                    <p><b>Dominate Animal: </b>See Enchantment, Mind- Affecting. </p>
                    <p><b>Dominate Monster: </b>See Enchantment, Mind- Affecting. </p>
                    <p><b>Dominate Person: </b>See Enchantment, Mind- Affecting. </p>
                    <p><b>Drawmij's Instant Summons:</b> The item cannot be summoned through closed domain borders. Elemental Swarm: See Conjuration (Summoning). At the end of the spell's duration, each summoned dread elemental must make a Will save. If the save is successful, you no longer have any control over that creature; it may run amok or even attack you. If the dread elemental fails its save, it vanishes without incident, returning to the Mists. </p>
                    <p><b>Energy Drain:</b> As enervation, except that any person killed by this spell must succeed at a Will save or become an undead creature (of the DM's choice) with as many HD as the victim had levels. </p>
                    <p><b>Enervation:</b> For each negative level the subject gains, she also takes 1 point of permanent hit point damage unless a cleric casts lesser restoration on the subject within one day, restoration within one week, or greater restoration within thirty days. In Ravenloft, the maximum number of temporary hit points this spell can give an undead creature is 50. Casting this spell requires a powers check. </p>
                    <p><b>Ethereal Jaunt:</b> See Ethereal. </p>
                    <p><b>Etherealness:</b> See Ethereal. </p>
                    <p><b>Find the Path: </b>This spell cannot find locations outside the domain in which it is cast. If Mists surround the domain, you can focus on them to reach the border. </p>
                    <p>The Realm of Dread contains a few physical portals to other worlds. If such an exit is within the domain, this spell can guide you to it, provided you know what you're looking for.</p>

                    <h>Description</h>
                    <p>Another method of fortune-telling comes from the Amber Wastes in the mysterious land of Har' Akir. According to legend, the gods gave the first dikesha set to the founding pharaoh of Har' Akir to assist him in his rule. The dikesha consists of five differently colored six-sided dice. The faces of the dice are marked with unique heiroglyphs. When tossed as a set, a skilled reader can divine something of the future by studying the symbols.</p>

                    <h>Creation</h>
                    <p>Each die is dedicated to one of the gods of Har' Akir's pantheon and lnked to a different phase of the moon. They are carved from the bones of a sentient creature that died or was killed during a different phase of the moon for each die. Thus, to create the red die, or rakesha, an intelligent being must have ended his life under the light of the new moon. When the die is finished, the artisan places it in a brass bowl filled with inks made from plants found only in the Amber Wastes. It charges in the light of the appropriate moon until a complete cycle has passed. If the gods approve, the dikesha, then change color and gain the power of prophecy. This process is repeated for each die in the set, and must be handled personally by the one who wishes to use them.</p>
                    <p>Using the d20 system, the creator must make a Craft (carving) check (DC20) and spend at least 1d4 months working on the set. How you handle the acquisition of sentient creature bones is up to you as a DM, but gaining them should add some time to the proces - not to mention a few enemies for the character.</p>
                    <p>Once created, the dikesha cannot be passed along to another without the intercession of a high priest and the approval of the Akiri gods through a series of ceremonies taking place during the course of a lunar cycle. When the month has ended, the priest hands over the dikesha to their new owner. If the gods approve the dice retain their color and power, if not, they fade in power and hue until nothing is left but useless bone.</p>

                    <h>Casting the Future</h>
                    <p>it is very easy for a DM to prepare to use the dikesha. Find 5 six-sided dice, one of each of the following colors: red, white, orange, yellow, and green. ROll them on a flat surface and consult:</p>

                        <link class="reference_manualtextwide" recordname="reference.refmanualdata.refpage_themanysides@Ravenloft Supplemental">The Many Sides of the Dikesha</link>
                    </linklist>
                    <p>You do not have to read the dice rolled in any particular order. Just put them in some logical sequence for your prophecy, taking time to study how they fell to increase the player suspense.</p>
                    <p>Since &#34;stacking the deck&#34; is impossible with dice, consider assigning different elements of the plot to each die and deciding before the reading what the various outcomes will be.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the question is, &#34;How do we find the kidnapped girl?&#34; A player rolls the dice. The red die comes up as &#34;The Road&#34; (4); the orange die as &#34;The Gem&#34; (3); the yellow die as &#34;Creation&#34; (2); and the green die as &#34;Curiosity&#34; (5).</p>
                    <p>Your answer might be &#34;Curiosity will lead you to a forgotten road.  To gain the help of the warrior, give him a globe of fire.  His creation will find the way.&#34;</p>
                    <p>In your subsequent plot, have the characters notice a grown-over path that was previously overlooked.  Subsequent investigation leads the characters to a gnome with a taste for rubies, he gladly leads them to the hidden cave where the youngster is being held.</p>
                    <p>If the yellow die rolled, &#34;Stasis&#34;, you could have decided that the girl was turned to stone inside the cave.  If the orange die's result was, &#34;The Chariot&#34;, consider a scene with the gnome's pony running away with his master's newly invented wagon.  He is willing to help because the heroes saved his life.</p>
                    <p>If you keep the answers suggestive of your plot, but are willing to adjust details of what you've planned to accommodate the die roll, you should be able to extrapolate a suitable fortune that fits well with the story.</p>
